# TierList

This is a small program for making **tier lists** with images and gifs.

It contains no ads and no social features.

## Problem

Content creators often make ranking videos where they divide items (e.g., games,
software, artists) into tiers (e.g., S-tier, D-tier).

When making these videos, software designed for digital drawing and image
processing (e.g., GIMP, Krita) is often used.

While these are excellent pieces of software, they are needlessly powerful for
such a simple task.

There are dedicated tier list apps but they are often bloated, with social media
features and monetisation efforts.

## Usage

* Double click `index.html` and it will open in your browser
* Upload the images that you want to use
* Drag images into tiers
* Use <kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>LMB</kbd> for multi-select actions
* When images are selected, use <kbd>ENTER</kbd> to view the fill image
* Viewing multiple images opens them in a slideshow
* For screenshots, there is a zenmode
